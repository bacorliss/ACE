# The magntiude of effect sizefrom normal data follows the folded normal 
# distribution and converges to the normal distribution as mu>>sigma





# 1A Show examples of histograms of normals transformed into 



# Test to show that generated samples follow folded normal



# Quantile plot that shows samples follows folded normal


# Show how mean is changed as x_bar increases from zero


# Show how std increases as x_bar changes from zero
